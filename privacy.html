                <p>
                    At CribScore, we believe in complete privacy. <strong>We collect absolutely no data from you.</strong> 
                    This privacy policy explains our simple approach: your data stays on your device, period.

                <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
                    <strong>CribScore collects NO information whatsoever.</strong> We don't track you, we don't 
                    collect analytics, we don't gather crash reports, and we don't know anything about you or 
                    your device.
                </p>

                <h3 style="color: #000080; margin-top: 20px;">What Stays on YOUR Device:</h3>
                <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">

                    <strong>Bottom Line:</strong> Everything you do in CribScore stays on your iPhone. 
                    We have no servers, no databases, and no way to see your data. It's as private as 
                    keeping score with a pencil and paper!
